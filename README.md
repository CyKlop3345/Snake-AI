#### Snake
Learning how to create lite AI for the Snake.
To start run "App.py" file.

#### Already have:
* Simple game with the snake and apples.
* Snake controlled by AI
* AI:
    * sees barrier in forward, left and right sides by one cell
    * knows direction to the apple
    * doesn't know how to avoid dead ends

#### Bug review:
* "apples" may spawn in the snake.
* You may also control snake,
but you need manually change option "self.RUNNING_AI" in App.py from 1 to 0

#### Planing:
* Add some gif and pic for GitHub
* Add user interface with interactive
  * changing controller
  * Neuron network graph
  * Stats of the game
